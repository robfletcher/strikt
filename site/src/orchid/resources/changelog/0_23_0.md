## Rancorous Horizon

- Adds `with` function for performing blocks of assertions on a derived subject. See [#117](https://github.com/robfletcher/strikt/issues/117)
- Many assertion functions may now be used in infix style. See [#187](https://github.com/robfletcher/strikt/pull/187)
- Improves presentation of multi-line values in expectation output. See [#158](https://github.com/robfletcher/strikt/issues/158)

### Breaking changes

- The `expectThat` override that accepts a lambda is now `Unit` rather than returning `Assertion.Builder`. See [#190](https://github.com/robfletcher/strikt/issues/190)
